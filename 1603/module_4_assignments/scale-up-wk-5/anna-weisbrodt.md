# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
I converted almost all of the views in my mod 3 personal project to React. 

### Link(s) to Your Work

 - [Github](https://github.com/AnnaCW/m3_personal_project/tree/react-dev-1)
 - All of my React work is on a branch called "react-dev-1." I have not merged the react dev branch into master or pushed it to production.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): .5
- Tuesday (8 hours): 5
- Wednesday (8 hours): 3
- Thursday (8 hours): 4
- Friday (0 hours): 3.5
- Saturday (0 hours): 3
- Sunday (0 hours): 4+


### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I didn't know about ESLint, which makes a big difference in helping to clean up files in a syntax I'm still learning. I also knew about but didn't really know how to use 'setState' to update page content. After this week, I really have an appreciation of how powerful and efficient React can be.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It was interesting to review PRs involving unfamiliar material and/or languages, though I wasn't able to offer specific suggestions. I also didn't receive much specific feedback, but it was a helpful exercise to open a PR knowing that it would be (or at least might be) reviewed by someone not familiar with the project.  

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Since everyone or almost everyone was working on something different, it was good to have this brief daily contact to stay in touch and know what others were working on. I like that we had such a variety of projects.   

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

# Instructor Evaluation:

Points: 150/150

Notes:

## Code

Do you plan to include the React work into master or eventually merge?

If not - I would strongly recommend linking the blog post and the branch in your master README

## Blog Post

Definitely link to the repo in the blog post

'I am using the react-rails gem.' - link directly to the gem
'My app uses the Spotify API’ - link directly to the api docs

In ‘artist/show.html.erb’: <- I would recommend linking directly to these files in github - it might be difficult because this is all on a branch - so you’ll want to update these links when/if you merge the branch (or leave the branch open) - but it will be very helpful for the future readers of this blog post.

'I received great advice from a developer with more React experience' - You may want to actually shout out by linking to the twitter or github of this person.

Inline code in the last two paragraphs should be visually lumped into code blocks

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
