### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
*  I made an effort to learn as much as I could about React and Electron over the past two weeks.  While I didn't implement as many features as I would have liked into my project, my understanding of React and Electron's APIs certainly became deeper.  I hope to continue pursuing these frameworks/libraries in future projects and continue to iterate on this project as well.

### Link to blog post(s)
[Blog Post](https://medium.com/@npisciotta/a-beginners-attempt-at-github-s-electron-6fe001ab561#.w4wmsww0z)
### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
* I certainly found all feedback I received to be helpful--mainly the comments on JS syntax.  I didn't have a lot of code to review, and most people aren't familiar with Electron, but there were still some helpful comments.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
* I enjoyed daily stand ups.  It was good to have an understanding of where everyone was at in their projects, and share with others my struggles and successes for my project.

# Instructor Evaluation:

Points: 150/150


# Notes

Great work tackling a hard challenge here. Very professional responses to feedback received on your PR - if I were looking at this repo as someone considering hiring you, I would be comforted by the level of detail on the PRs and professionalism.

You include how to run the app in the PR body here - https://github.com/nickpisciotta/electron_notes_app/pull/5 - make sure to also include those instructions in your README. Also, I suggest linking your blog post. Gives great context for whatâ€™s going on there. 

# Hours

52 total hours logged (between 7 to 8 hours a day)

# Blog

Great opening paragraph, really lays things out well. 

`React is a JS library that allows us to create composable user interfaces, and can be used with different web frameworks.` <- link to React page or docs inline here

`It harnesses a virtual DOM` <- link to definition of DOM or provide it for the reader

`Electron is an open-source framework developed by Github ` <- inline links to tech pages suggested

`Electron uses the latest versions of Chromium and Node, so you never have to worry if your user has the latest browser version
` <- readers not familiar with what Chromium is may not understand this connection

`Part of what drew me to Electron is how easy a new developer can make a functional desktop app without knowing Swift of Objective-C (for MacOSX development, at least), or operating system APIs. ` <- very nice bringing the reader back to the context of the blog

`The general layout would look something like this:` <- might be nice to add this diagram directly to the project README - when people look through your repos, they tend to assume pictures mean finished, professional product and a light, unformatted README means unfinished product. 

Suggest linking directly to repo somewhere in the blog

` I attempted to use Spectron along with the testing framework mocha,` <- library links suggested

`I could not get passed the following error:` <- `past` not `passed`

`Error: timeout of 1000ms exceeded. Ensure the done() callback is being called in this test.`<-  I believe this is what the error is referring to: http://justinbellamy.com/testing-async-code-with-mocha/

Great addition of resources at the end!

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)
