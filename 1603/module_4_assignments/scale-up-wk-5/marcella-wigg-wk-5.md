# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

I completed the barebones of a React/Redux app that allows a user to view interview questions about JavaScript. It took me a long time to set up the app and figure out how to get everything running locally, but now I have the basics of a functional app that can be run locally with gulp to compile. Coming from a background where I was used to using a local server, I found the whole setup process quite confusing, and ended up going through multiple tutorials and techniques in an attempt to get it functional. Finally, I have done so. It is nowhere near the point where it would be a great portfolio piece.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

I was much more confused about how to bring a React app together than I am now. I also was forced to learn quite a bit of ES6 syntax in this week.

### Link to blog post(s)

[Here](https://medium.com/@marcellawigg/gulp-a-love-story-c1d4e49e5dfb#.am57o3j3p) describing why I liked Gulp/Browserify.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I got a few comments on my PR that I submitted to the Slack channel; not a ton, but a little. I enjoyed submitting PR comments when I had them, which I did for Ilana and Charlie's this week, as well as some last week. It was interesting to look at what the team projects were working on and how they were reviewing content together.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

The standups were interesting when people attended, and I liked that we were all working on different projects, so we heard about different things that everyone was working on and were exposed to (at least in terms of familiarizing us with the terms of) new tech terminology. This last week, due to Denver Startup Week, I did feel that attendance significantly dropped, though.

# Notes

Don’t be too hard on yourself re: ‘no where near being a portfolio piece’! Link to the blog post in the README, include some screenshots, include links to the way you PLAN for it to look - diagrams, code pens, whatever. Just because it isn’t ‘done’ doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be proud of it - and most people who are looking through your Github will take whatever is in the README as face value. You put a lot of work into this and stretched yourself :D

# Hours

56 total hours logged (between 7 to 8 hours a day)

# Code

Don’t forget to include a link to your blog post in the README for the repo. 

PRs that have styling changes should, as a best practice, include a screen shot of the style change (or a gif if moving feature) https://github.com/marcellawigg/flashcards/pull/3 - Helps reviewers understand the style change without having to pull down and run the branch. 

# Blog

`I did not attend the first lecture for React for my ScaleUp project, which ended up having a serious impact on my ability to efficiently set up my project with Webpack: how does one get started with React?` We dive immediately in to a few assumptions with this first sentence - Things that would be unclear to a non-turing reader that you might want to clarify - what is Scale Up, what is WebPack and how does it relate to React (Webpack is actually probably less common that using Browserify and Gulp - so it won’t be assumed that you’d use Webpack even for someone who knows what it is) - What project are you working on and why does it use React?

`which ultimately was not helpful to me when working in my IDE.` <- what is an IDE and why was this not helpful?

`option to view my app locally. ` <- might require more clarity? View it locally? Like look at the code? Maybe something like ‘I could write React code on my computer all ay, but I needed to be able to compile it so I could run it in the browser as I developed’ 

`(according to Quora users, at least) ` <- I love this. But seriously, good way to give context to your tech choices
