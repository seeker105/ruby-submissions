# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

- Fully polished Turing Arcade - I thought this was going to be a quick process but I found that when polishing, it took more time to get it exactly production ready.
- Met with Ellen Mary Hickman about my new role as a TA at Turing. We spoke about how to be effective at student support and she gave me some to-do's.
- Did a portion of the Code Academy React Tutorial
- Attended classes that were important to me as a community member and developer
- Attended Denver Startup Week events. Mostly about diversity in tech.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

- Accessibility is a lot bigger problem on websites than I thought. It was upsetting but motivating to see how to change a website to become ADA accessible. I also went to a lot of DSW events and learned about the Denver Tech community.

# Blog

`Denver Startup Week (DSW)` <- link to site suggested

`Some language can seem gendered or appeal to a certain race or age demographic.` examples of this would be helpful

I’d actually recommend, instead of bullet points and links at the end - making each bullet point a paragraph, putting in bold a sentence that summarized the gist, and then adding the links into the paragraph rather than listing them at the bottom. Would help make things feel a little less disjointed.

Might need a summary paragraph - something like ‘please share in the comments your tips and tricks for companies to help support diversity in tech’ and/or a restating of why this is important or important to you
