### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
* **Week 1:** In week 1 my time was split between doing research on the feature toggle issue for LookingFor and for doing some Mod 5 prework, i.e. ironing out my resume, planning for Denver Startup Week, meeting with my mentor, and scheduling coffee meetings with contacts at companies I am interested in.

* **Week 2:** In week two I primarily focused on Denver Startup Week. I went to several sessions, including a session given by employees at Craftsy about how they restructured their app to have JS logic shared by their web app, iOS app, and Android app, utilizing React and a session given by an employee at Gusto about how they restructured their app from using Rails and jQuery to using React and Webpack. It was really interesting to see these two companies each reiterating the need to have DRYer, more maintainable apps and talking about how React was a key tool in this endeavor. During DSW I also went to several networking events, and I have sent emails to handful of people I met to have coffee and talk more about their work. I have two coffee meetings so far scheduled for next week.

### Hours logged this week?

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
React was a large thing I knew nothing about and definitely learned about from the prework. Previous to Scale Up, I had heard of React but did not know anything about it. Between the Creact tutorial, classes on React, and DSW talks, I learned a lot about the paradigm and benefits of React and I look forward to doing some more in-depth practice in Mod 5.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It was good practice to have to be diligent about looking at other people's code and comment meaningfully about it. I thought Meeka's introductory point about PRs was spot on-- it's important to be clear about the purpose of your comment. I tried to be explicit about when I wanted more information or was just curious about something versus suggesting an actual change.


### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Daily stand ups were a good way to stay informed about what other people in the group were working on. It was hard during Week 2 and all the DSW craziness to attend every stand up in person, but I really appreciated the staff's willingness to be flexible and allow us choices of standup times. In general I liked getting a chance to practice having the kind of meetings we will be having in the workplace.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?
I was very interested about Robbie's work with graphing job-related data. I think that this is probably the most impactful feature that could be on the site and I think it should be prioritized in work for future cohorts.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
Thanks again for being flexible with us during DSW. The week was a great chance to get some job stuff rolling, and I am very glad I was able to take full advantage of it!

Thanks for your feedback and for summarizing/wrapping things up well and being very involved with your team even when pivoting to focus on Start Up Week!

# Hours

# Blog

`Let’s look at the simplest example, a line of best fit` <- 
Even though you go on to explain it well, might be good to just add an inline link on ‘line of best fit’ to the definition - something like http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algebra/ad4/linefit.htm

`Update the line to be a slightly better fit. Assess how bad that line is.` <- ‘how bad that line is’ reads a little bit unprofessional - what defines bad? Would ‘inaccurate’ be better here?

`or at least describes it least-badly.` <- okay, actually this part made me laugh so actually maybe just put ‘bad’ in quotes above.

If you have any examples, it might be good at the end of the blog post to provide links to resources where this technique is being used or where the reader can get more information
