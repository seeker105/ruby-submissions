# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

My goal over the past two weeks was to incorporate some charts into the LookingFor site. The charts would give some visual representation about the job market at the moment and over time. I decided to investigate using D3.js alongside the React front end. My work was mainly research focuses since I did not know React or the D3 libraries. In order to get charts to render on the page within the time allotted, I decided to use the rd3 library, which is a high-level version of D3.js and functions as React components.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

Before this week, I didn't know the difference between state and props within React. I took some time to investigate this difference and know when to use either of them. The AJAX call to get data from the back-end uses state to pass that data to a component, and if I need to set an attribute of a component, that is most likely to be static, then I use props.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I merged a PR from Brian that fixed the bug for routing and opening links in new tabs. Before I merged it, I made sure there were comments from others and the comments were addressed. I also checked the staging app that Brian put together to test the bug in production. I could not reproduce the bug, so I went ahead and merged the PR.

I have submitted two PRs for review, but I am still waiting for feedback.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I found it difficult to know how much detail to put into my stand up talk. I tended to stay very high level unless I was having blockers or issues. Then I would go into a little more detail.

Points: 110/150

# Hours

51 total hours logged (between 7 to 8 hours a day)

# Code

Left some comments in your PRs (one on Active record, one on including screen shots for visual changes in PRs). Great work on all of this - I’m not shocked that you managed to pull it off, but I’m definitely impressed!

Thank you for putting in the extra effort at the end to get this wrapped up and merged well - and for handling the places where past students maybe didn't dilligently wrap things up....

# Blog

Good start on the blog - I’ll leave the grade open and I hope you get a chance to finish it up (mainly so that selfishly, I can add it to the project as great documentation for students to keep working on this part - and so that I can share it with the front end students) - if you do get it wrapped up, shoot me the link and I’ll update this grade/form.
