### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
Over these last two weeks I worked quite a bit on experimenting with Ember Simple Auth as well as learning more about Handlebars. The work that we were doing on this project did not directly work well with pairing, as it was mostly just researching how to accomplish something instead of hard and fast logic, so I spent most of my time researching and spiking alternative options to what my partner was working on. I attempted to implement the functionality more on the Ember side of things (Taking advantage of Ember simple auth) while my partner focused more on the initial plan of the project.      

These spikes did not get implemented in the final code, however I feel like they did contribute to the overall success of the project as it prevented us from diving deeper into rabit holes later on in the process.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

I did not have pre-work for the MentoSHIP project, but I did spend a fair amount of time prior to the project researching SalesForce and Apex. I completed a tutorial in SalesForce that was a simple suggestion box application and was amazed at how much was done upfront for you. Creating databases in SalesForce is incredibly easy, and the ease of use is remarkable.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

I did not get as much experience doing this as I would have wanted. My development spikes did not result in code that would make it to the final product, so I lost out on the opportunity to have my code reviewed. Additionally, me and Chris stayed in pretty constant communication about the code that was being written, and generally met up to review code before any pull requests were made. Due to this I rarely saw code in a PR that I had not already been exposed to/ discussed with my partner.     
There were Other people pushing code that I was able to look over, however many of the PR's that I saw were smaller scale and did not have a lot of room for discussion, or worked in a completely foreign framework where I felt I had little to nothing to contribute to the discussion.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I enjoyed the Daily stand ups much more than I anticipated I would. I am not an overly talkative person, so talking about what I am currently working on is difficult. I am looking forward to getting the opportunity to practice this more at my future job, as right now I am much more comfortable showing you what I am working on and answering any questions you have about it.      
I did however greatly enjoy hearing what other people were working on. I found it very interesting to hear some of the struggles people were experiencing with the various frameworks and projects they were working with. I also enjoyed hearing their victories and seeing all of the cool things people could accomplish with all of the different tools.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?
I would like to see the next group that takes it get the account creation for student/mentors up and running, as well as iron out any of the complications our hardcoded redirects for Oauth introduced.

The following issues need more follow up - but I believe both sets of issues in either repo need clarity across the board: 

- https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-API/issues/19
- https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd/issues/9
- https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd/issues/8
- https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd/issues/7

In general, the issues that were created do that have enough detail. Since the work that was merged did not include any documentation updates, there would be no way for someone to pick up most of these issues without spending a ton of time digging throught he code and commit history.

For the pull request review, even if it is just a spike, there's nothing wrong with dropping some of the work you're doing on a spike into the Pr Review channel to just get some feedback on the work in progress.

Since Chris did the majority of the code committed, one way you can handle that situation is to document your spikes in the project basecamp. Right now, all the work you did one spiking the other solution is kind of lost to the project. No one can learn from what you did because there's not documentation on the approach and why it wasn't a good fit.
