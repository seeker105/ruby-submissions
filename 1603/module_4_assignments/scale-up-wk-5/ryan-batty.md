# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks

Over the course of Scale Up, I did a focused research spike on using Vapor, a web development framework written entirely in Swift.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

Prior to this week, I had absolutely zero experience with Swift. I had never seen it's syntax or a code sample. By the end, I was able to comprehend and write rudimentary Swift code in the context of Vapor.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

Unfortunately, PR's were an area I really slacked on during the course of this project. Between balancing Startup Week and working on something that I had experience in, I wasn't able to find something to really ask for input on. Its definitely something I hope to improve on in the future.

That said, I did use PR's whenever I added a new feature, and documented them appropriately. I also browsed other's PR's for input and inspiration on what I could do better in the future.


### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I enjoyed having stand ups during this project. It was interesting being able to keep tabs on other projects, share our experiences, and overall felt a little more professional than past projects at Turing.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Between Startup Week, Job Search, and the volatility of Vapor itself, this project presented a strange set of challenges for me. In the past, I had been able to dedicate lots of time to just plowing through challenges with a new code base, but I was not able to do that here. The state of the framework I was using was constantly changing, with methods and classes sometimes phasing out on a daily basis.  I often found myself spending time researching things more than actually implementing, which was definitely strange and different.

Overall, I think my project deliverables transitioned drastically and while that was not intended, I am grateful to the experience, because I feel it is something I will definitely have to deal with again later in my career.

# Instructor Evaluation:

Points: 130/150

## Code

Your README still has a lot of the boilerplate stuff in it - so other than the app description there isn’t much in there about what your app specifically does. At minimum I would recommend removing the link to the Vapor example repo and putting in a link to your blog

All code was supposed to be pull requested in to the project - and in addition, any pull request with 18 files would be too difficult for a review to dive into. Especially given the fact that you were working on the bleeding edge of tech, it’s super important to break pull requests up. At minimum, I would expect the font files and bootstrap to be pull requested in separately from the routing. (Something to keep in mind for future projects!)

## Hours

Over the two weeks, 56 total hours logged (between 7 to 8 hours a day)

## Blog Post

Awesome opening section - got me interested in reading right off the bat.

 You may want to link to the home pages of some of the languages that you mention. For a completely new developer, they may not know how to google their way into finding ‘swift’ which is something we take for granted after Turing :D

'The Slack channel is constantly active’ - link to the slack channel

Really lovely summary of your trials - gives great context, paints the community and the software in a positive and realistic light. Really good blog post and one I would point folks towards happily!

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 20: Developer was absent for 1 stand up, did not participate actively in code reviews.

See notes above on the pull requests and reviews. Participation otherwise was excellent.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
