## Basics

### Link(s) to the PRs or Issues You Picked Up
-[#71 Links to Job Posting Broken (closed)](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/issues/71)
-[#76 Replace AJAX requests with promises (open)](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/issues/76)
-[#78 Clean up dependencies (open)](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/issues/78)

### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks
- Worked on fixing a high-priority bug involving the Express server and React-Router. Issue was resolved and closed with a reviewed PR.
- Looked at converting some jQuery AJAX requests to using a promise-based HTTP library called axios.  Issue is still open but PR is up and production-ready.
- While looking at reducing the use of jQuery, I also researched how we could clean up some dependencies and improve performance. Issue remains open but a PR is in the works.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): 1 hour. Most of my time was spent doing the assessment today. DSW opening party!
- Tuesday (8 hours): 3.5 hours. Standup, React talk at the Craftsy office. More DSW stuff. Some light programming.
- Wednesday (8 hours): 3 hours. React talk at DSW. Tested server/router changes on Heroku.
- Thursday (8 hours): 2 hours. Worked on API requests. 
- Friday (0 hours): 4.5 hours. Fixed some testing issues with API requests, commenting on PR's
- Saturday (0 hours): 5 hours. Research on HTTP libraries, worked on Blog post.
- Sunday (0 hours): 6 hours. API stuff, Blog post, research on React-Bootstrap and removing jQuery.

- Grand Total: ~59 hours tracked.


### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

- My prework consisted mostly of playing around with React in Lovisa's 'creact' tutorial.
- I worked through converting some of the AJAX requests to using fetch and promises during the prework.
- The creact tutorial bundled React views onto a Rails application, so I enjoyed learning about the differences between implementing React views inside a Rails application, as well as working with React as a separate application in the lookingFor project.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

- I really liked my experience receiving feedback on PR's.  It was an opportunity to showcase and explain what I was doing, as well as to document my process in solving problems.
- Previous students on the project commented on my PR's, and I really liked getting their perspective or jumping in to answer questions brought up by teammates.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

- Standups were mostly helpful for me to clarify what I should be prioritizing each day.
- I also enjoyed hearing about what other people were working on and their experiences going to Denver Startup Week events 
- Standups were also a good time to give each other gentle feedback on the process or to request an extra set of eyes.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

- I'd like to see the project get a makeover in the styling department.
- Also excited to see what Robbie has done with his visualizations using D3, there are some really cool graphs that could be iterated on in the future.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

- Can I continue making contributions to the project after Scale-Up? I'd like to finish some of the work that I've started up but haven't had a chance to merge in yet.
- Did the Scale Up project suffer because of Denver Start Up week from the persepctive of the instructors? I felt like we weren't able to move as quickly as I expected because of all the events going on.
- Another comment: why can't we make a culture of instructors giving code-reviews on Github when evaluating projects? I think it would be cool to have notes on Github documenting actionable items that students could work on to improve their applications.

# Notes 

OMG yas you can totally continue to contribute to and work on LookingFor after Scale Up. I usually keep past students as admins on the project for as long as possible, hoping they will do so.

The Scale Up definitely was effected heavily by Start Up Week - it’s meant to be flexible so you can either heavily dive into something and explore OR when life events happen, be able to serve as a release valve. This was the first time we leaned heavily on the release valve part, and for most of the cohort instead of a few people here or there - so there wasn’t as much code flying around - which is a bummer in some ways but actually feels really realistic in terms of what happens at companies. It’s probably the way it felt at companies that were super involved with Start Up Week - like I’m guessing Gusto and Quick Left employees were crazy unproductive that week. Companies invest heavily in community events like that, so I’m glad we could do it too.

From the instructor standpoint, I felt like 1603 had a successful Scale Up outcome - but I recognize that it probably feels a little like ‘uh.. are we good?’ from a student standpoint - and I hope it wasn’t too loosely run for students who weren’t fully 100% in for Start Up Week.

# Blog

Great explanation and linking of relevant topics. I feel like this is a blog post that someone in Mod 3 back end would be able to read through and understand/research their way easily into understanding.

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
