# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the work you completed over the last two weeks
Over the last two weeks I spent time re-learning the basics of linear regression and the basics of Python.  By the end of the two weeks I was able to code out a single variable linear regression in Python.  I was using data retrieved from a library called mlbgame with the goal of finding a best fit for the relationship between total team hits and total runs scored in a season.

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

My experience with PR reviews and getting feedback was very positive.  It was a new experience using github as a medium for feedback.  At times it felt a bit forced which I think is part of the learning process.  At other times it was very nice to hear other people's thoughts and engage in healthy code discussions with people who might not otherwise read your code.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Daily stand ups brought me back to my work days.  I think there is great value in stand ups.  I enjoy hearing what everyone is up to and I love the opportunity to gather feedback without having to make an extra effort to do so or feel like I'm putting people out.

Repo looks like it has details on running the code in the un-merged branch for the README - which is great. I’d challenge you to add a bit more detail on what the goal of the project is in that README as well (and definitely a link to your blog - which might be all you need since the blog gives a great explanation of the ‘why this is cool'). You may also want to add attribution for where the included sample data set came from and separate the data sets into their own folder. I took a few classes on data analysis on the internet, so CLEARLY I AM AN EXPERT, but I do think that’s a best practice… haha

If you continue working on this, one thing I would probably look at if I were reviewing this code for someone I was thinking of hiring would be having some simple unit tests, especially since you think you may currently have a bug. Since your test data is passed in and not hard coded, you should be able to throw some simple tests around it without too much heavy refactoring. 

# Blog

' I plan to use Requests, a Python library used for making API calls, and Statsmodels, a Python module used for statistical tests and analysis such as regression.
For my baseball data resource I plan on using a Python API called “mlbgame” that retrieves and reads MLB GameDay XML data.’ <- I’d recommend including links to the data sets and libraries directly 

Don’t forget to include a link to the repo in your blog

This is a random thought, but I have a few blog posts that I wrote optimistically talking about how I was going to keep working on a thing (and then life happened and I didn’t keep working). You might want to tweak the ending of your blog to focus more on what you did during the time and assume that you won’t work on the project after the two weeks - that way, if you do pick this back up, you can write a follow up post and if you don’t, the blog doesn’t read like an unfulfilled promise (HEYO JAVASCRIPT JOKES)

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
