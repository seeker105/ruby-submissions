# Goals

Whether you're going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.

This could be something like 'learn GoLang', 'contribute to open source', 'improve my JavaScript abilities', 'build a weird thing'

At the end of module 3, you became a 'real developer' - so when you think about how to achieve these goals you should be thinking of them like a developer would. For example, if you walk in to an interview and say you know Go, that means you've built something in Go, not that you've taken a codeschool AND codacademy course in Go and followed along with a TODO app tutorial.

Focus on real ways you can demonstrate your learning and motivate yourself to keep at it.

### Identify

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.

#### -Create an Open Source package
##### Currently at:
I've got an idea, but that's about it. I'm going to have to use CoffeeScript and I've looked at that language and done some very small 'function'-ish code in it.
##### Success after 1 year:
Having a published open source package.
##### Resources

##### Why is this important?
I can create something that will solve a real problem that I have and other people have.

#### -Give a conference talk
##### Currently at:
Not started yet.
##### Success after 1 year:
Having presented a talk at a group like Denver.rb beginner track.
##### Resources
[meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Denver-rb/)
I'd like to go to a meetup and see a talk to get an idea of what kind of topics are appropriate.
##### Currently building
##### Talks Currently Writing
##### Open Source Projects
##### Why is this important?
I've discovered that I enjoyed doing a talk and I want to get more practice.

#### -Get a Job

##### Currently building

##### Open Source Projects
##### Why is this important?
This is a life goal. Doing this will let me spend my life doing something I enjoy

### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
    - e.g. 'I have given a lightning talk on Go', 'I downloaded EMACS', 'I am at an intermediate level with JavaScript'
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?
