### Participation

I participated in two PRs from Nick Pisciotta and Brian Sayler. Since I am working independently, my comments aren't as directly relevant as they would be if I were collaborating on a project, but nevertheless I did make an effort to comment on others' projects and follow what they were doing.

### Work Completed

My code is [here](https://github.com/marcellawigg/flashcards). I spent a LOT of time working on tutorials and stuff, but somehow I was struggling to configure this app beyond the basics, and tried several different methods without a ton of success. I think my lack fo focus this week hurt me with this project, and need to work on it some more.
